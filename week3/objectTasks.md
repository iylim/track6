Objects -> How to:

- [ ] make an object
  - [ ] Object.create
  - [ ] {}
- [ ] Construct objects (Capitalize first letter)
  - [ ] Function
- [ ] add to that object
- [ ] Delete from an object
- [ ] Access the object
  - [ ] Dot
  - [ ] Bracket
  - [ ] Everything is a string in the keys
- [ ] Enumerate through the keys / values of an object
  - [ ] forâ€¦in
  - [ ] Object.key
  - [ ] Object.value
- [ ] Modify
  - [ ] Change a property somewhere and see how it effects
- [ ] Copy an object
  - [ ] Shallow:
    - [ ] Object.assign
    - [ ] Object spread syntax
  - [ ] Deep Copy:
    - [ ] JSON (stringify and parse)
- [ ] Destructuring

Classes are a wrapper for a function

- [ ] Creates an object similar to Highly OOP languages

Theoretical

Inheritance:

- [ ] Prototypes: - [ ] Tie in the fact that object methods are reconstructed every time you make an object - [ ] Prototypes share the functionality among similar types
