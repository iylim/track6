## Grammar and Good Practices

## Types

I sorted these into types that I use frequently. I figured it be useful to study things that might appear more often.

### String

### Boolean

- Properties:
  - true of false

<!-- TODO: Where should we put Truthy and Falsey? -->

### Number

- Properties:
  - 64-bit value
  - Integer or float
  - Positive or negative
  - Special `Number` key words:
    - `Infinity`
    - `-Infinity`
    - `NaN`
- Math Details:
  - Order of operations (PEMDAS) still applies
  - All operations on numbers result in floating-point arithmetic.
    - `/`: Standard division does not truncate decimal values; it maintains floating point precision.
    - `%`: Modulus operator still takes the remainder.
    - Since floating-point rules apply, be careful of high-precision results; you could lose precision.

### null

### undefined

### Object

### Symbol

### BigInt (New)

## Scoping

_Scope_ refers to the part of a program where a variable is visible or available.

For variables defined outside of any function or block, the scope is the whole program‚Äîyou can refer to such bindings wherever you want.
These are called _global_.

But variables created for function parameters or declared inside a function can be referenced only in that function, so they are known as _local_ variables.
This provides some isolation between functions‚Äîeach function call acts in its own little world (its local environment) and can often be understood without knowing a lot about what‚Äôs going on in the global environment.

## `let`, `const`, and `var`

In JavaScript we have three words to declare variables: `let`, `const`, and `var`.

In the pre-ES6 days (before 2015), `var` was the only way to declare variables in JS.
The scope of a variable declared with `var` is its _current execution context_, which is either the enclosing function or, for variables declared outside any function, global.
This means variables defined with `var` are **not** block scoped.

Variables declared with `let` and `const`, however, are in fact local to the block that they are declared in. If you create one of those inside of a loop, the code before and after the loop cannot ‚Äúsee‚Äù it.

This brings us to a classic problem

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}
```

What do you think this will output?
How can we fix it to output "correctly"?

### Immutability

The difference between `let` and `const` is that a variable declared with `let` (and `var`) can be reassigned whereas a `const` cannot (hence the term **const**ant).

```js
let myLetStr = "First it's this";
myLetStr = "Now it's this"; // This is fine

const myConstStr = "Hello";
myConstStr = "Goodbye"; // Not allowed
// will raise TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

We should prefer to use `const` wherever possible in order to reduce confusion with reassignment.
If our program ever tries to reassign something unexpectedly, we will get an error.

## Hoisting

_Hoisting_ can be thought of as automatically bringing variable declarations to the top of their respective blocks so that variables can be used before they are declared.

The actual definition is a bit more complex:

> Conceptually, for example, a strict definition of hoisting suggests that variable and function declarations are physically moved to the top of your code, but this is not in fact what happens. Instead, the variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase, but stay exactly where you typed them in your code.
>
> ‚Äî [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)

Only `var` and `function` declarations are hoisted.
One of the advantages of this is that it allows you to use a function before you declare it in your code.

```js
catName("Chloe"); // This will work fine

function catName(name) {
  console.log("My cat's name is " + name);
}
```

We can also do this with `var` declarations:

```js
myCat = "Chloe";
console.log(myCat); // This will work fine
var myCat;
```

For all intents and purposes the interpreter sees

```js
var myCat;
myCat = "Chloe";
console.log(myCat); // This will work fine
```

Notice that I still had to define (assign) the variable before using it.
_Declarations_ will be hoisted, _definitions_ will not.

Accessing an undeclared `var` variable will yield `undefined`.

```js
console.log(myCat); // This will work fine, but will print "undefined"
var myCat;
```

üôÑ You're probably starting to notice how confusing this all is.

Personally, I am fine with hoisted function declarations.
It allows us to write functional code without having to worry about order.
We can organize our code in a way that makes sense for us.

However, I think it is a bit wack that variables can be used before they are declared.
This is one of the reasons `let` and `const` were added to the spec in ES6.

Notice:

```js
myCat = "Chloe"; // This will crash the program
console.log(myCat);
let myCat;
```

This code errors on the first line with `ReferenceError: myCat is not defined`.
I think this is much more expected behavior.
We get an actual error when a variable is accessed in an unexpected location.

An error, rather than silently evaluating to `undefined`, is much more helpful for debugging.

These are a few of the reasons JavaScript developers should prefer `let`/`const` over `var`.

## Operations

## Program Structure

## Functions

There are a few ways to create functions in JavaScript.

```js
// or you can use let or var
const power = function(num, exp) {
  return num ** exp;
};
```

```js
function power(num, exp) {
  return num ** exp;
}
```

In JavaScript, functions are _first-class citizens_.
This means a function can be treated like any variable:
you can use it in arbitrary expressions, not just call it.
It is possible to store a function value in a new variable, pass it as an argument to a function, and so on.
Similarly, a variable that holds a function is still just a regular variable and can, if not constant, be assigned a new value, like so:

```js
let launchMissiles = function() {
  missileSystem.launch("now");
};
if (safeMode) {
  launchMissiles = function() {
    /* do nothing */
  };
}
```

### Why do we care?

JavaScript is full of objects. In fact, you could go so far to say that _EVERYTHING_ in JavaScript is an object.

_If people feel skeptical, tell them to wait for the prototype chain part_

We want to be able to make something that has data and manipulate that data in an organized, scalable, extensible way.

### Basics: Objects

#### Anatomy of an Object

- **Property:** any key / value pair where:
  - Key: must be a string or [Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)
  - Value: anything

#### Execution

There are a few ways to make raw objects.

```js
const obj1 = {};
const obj2 = Object.create();

//----------Functions-----------------

function MyObject() {
  return {};
}
obj3 = MyObject();

function MyConstructor(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
obj4 = new MyConstructor("bob");
```

Teaching Instructions:

- Start attaching things to the object and showing how JavaScript is a dynamic language.
- Show that variables and functions being values in a property.

### The Secret Life of Objects

TODO: Figure out what this is...

### Basics: Prototypes

How do we know what an object should do? How are we supposed to interact with these various things that are floating around our program?

Traditionally,

When you make a string:

```js
const str = "hello";
```

Teaching instructions:

- Dive into the object
- Take a look at the \_proto\_ chain of each of these things and explain that everything has attached functionality, because everything is an object.
- Add a method to the prototype chain and make multiple objects from it.

That string variable `str` gets converted into the JavaScript equivalent of the `String` class. Each of those strings have available methods (modifiers of class data) to use.

![String methods](console-string-methods.png)

And this is what it looks like when you investigate the String \_proto\_ that is attached to every String object.

![String prototype](console-string-prototype.png)

### New-ish: ES6 Classes

A stylistic wrapper to make OOP easier to use is `class` syntax. A class is a template that can be used to construct objects. If you are more familiar with C-based languages, this will feel right at home.

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const dog = new Pet("Max");
```

We are not just limited to data as well; we can supply methods to manipulate said data.

```js
class Pet {
  static isDog(animal) {
    return Object.getPrototypeOf(animal).constructor.name === this.name;
  }

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  doTrick(trick) {
    console.log(`I can ${trick}. Watch this!`);
  }
}
```

Methods can be added to classes:

- `doTrick(trick)` is a method specific to the object instance. In other words, it is used to manipulate data that could be changed among objects of the same class.
- `isDog(animal)` is a static method. Static methods are like prototypes where they can be shared among objects and their effects are the same.

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  doTrick(trick) {
    console.log(`I can ${trick}. Watch this!`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }

  sit() {
    console.log(`I am sitting`);
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog("Mike");
myDog.doTrick("jump");

// Output: I can jump. Watch this!
```

Inheritance can also be used with the `extends` key word. Classes the inherit must use the `super` keyword to pass data to the parent's constructor to initialize data.

### Theory of OOP

Four pillars of OOP:

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

#### Abstraction

In computers we never make the things we represent; we make abstractions of those concepts. OOP can represent real-life objects like animals, cars, people. However, it can also represent a process or idea. Not everything needs to be real, but objects can create structure for it, nonetheless.

#### Encapsulation

Do you want data to be relevant to the object? Do you want methods to manipulate that data?

Encapsulation gives you a space that is separated from the outside environment (in loose terms).

#### Inheritance

I have something that is strongly related to another thing. Maybe they have some sort of relationship or share data / functionality

Inheritance allows you to build relationships between objects so that you do not have to rewrite code in those objects.

Ex: Everything in JS is an object. The `String` class **inherits** from the `Object` class to get some basic methods.

**WARNING** Inheritance can be dangerous if too vertical relationships are made. Changes in the base class ripple down through all child classes.

#### Polymorphism

More advanced, can be covered later.

## Bugs and Error Handling

### Debugging

### Error Handling

#### Try / Catch

When you have a block of code that could be prone to errors / bugs, you might want to wrap it in a `try {}` block. However, every `try` block should have a proceeding `catch() {}` block along with it

```js
const getUserData (database) {
  try {
    const data = database.find('user');
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
```

If the code within the `try` block fails:

- It immediately generates an `Error` object that breaks the normal programming flow.
- This object will travel up the call stack until something resolves the error or the program crashes.

The first thing that could resolve the error is the `Catch` block. In the code snippet above, `err` is the `Error` object that was generated when `database.find('user')` failed. All we do with the error is resolve it by logging it to the console. Since I don't know what to do with the error right now, logging it is the best I can do.

#### Throw

Continuing our example from above, a better solution to handling an error we don't know what to do with is to `throw` the error.

```js
const getUserData (database) {
  try {
    const data = database.find('user');
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    throw err; // DEV: Now I added a throw expression.
  }
}
```

Now, my error handling allows whatever called `getUserData()` to deal with the error and logs the issue where it happened (better for debugging).

**Just be careful!** If you never resolve the problem and continue to throw the error, your program will crash.

#### Finally (new to JS)

Continuing our example from above... If I had something that **MUST** be done after my `try` and `catch` blocks, it can be done in a `finally` block.

```js
const getUserData (database) {
  try {
    const data = database.find('user');
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    throw err;
  } finally {
    console.log('Database operations: Finished'); // DEV: log when done.
  }
}
```

Now, in my `finally` block, I log when this function completes **NO MATTER WHAT**.

If the `try` block is:

- Successful: `try -> finally`
- Unsuccessful: `try -> catch -> finally`

**Just be careful!** If you have code that fails in the finally, there is no `catch` block to save you.
