## What the heck is JavaScript really?

A high-level single-threaded, garbage-collected, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled), prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language with a non-blocking event loop.

## JavaScript and ECMAScript

Show off video: [Weird History of JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh6lK57Cuk4)

JavaScript: A programming language.

ECMAScript: A standard for scripting languages.

JavaScript is an **IMPLEMENTATION** OF ECMAScript. There is a group of people called the European Computer Manufacturer's Association (ECMA) that come up with all of the rules and regulations for what a good scripting language should have.

When we say:

- ES5
- ES6 / ES2015
- ES.Next (everything else determined by year of release)

![JavaScript History](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/javascript-article-assets/javascript_timeline.svg)

JavaScript moves as quickly as it can with the standards, but the standards will always be ahead of the implementation.

The language is constantly evolving and will add new features after you finish this cohort training. Keep up with the new features, but understand that not all new features can be supported in legacy systems.

Check out this [compatibility chart](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) to see what I mean.

## Where is JavaScript heading?

[The Birth and Death of JavaScript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript) (video)

> This science fiction / comedy / absurdist / completely serious talk traces the history of JavaScript, and programming in general, from 1995 until 2035. It's not pro- or anti-JavaScript; the language's flaws are discussed frankly, but its ultimate impact on the industry is tremendously positive.

## Documentation

<!-- TODO: -->

## Commenting

As a developer, you should make sure your code is as readable and helpful to other developers as possible. It doesn't need to start that way (hacky code is always nice to start out), but your final code should be documented clearly.

- Single Line comments:

```js
// Welcome to JS!
```

- Multi-line comments:

```js
/*
 * These are multi-line comments.
 * You can just put anything in here and
 * white-space won't effect the comments.
 */
```

- [JSDoc Hints](https://devhints.io/jsdoc): Standard JavaScript documentation.

```js
/**
 * This is a function.
 *
 * @param {string} n - A string param
 * @return {string} A good string
 *
 * @example
 *
 *     foo('hello')
 */
function foo(n) {
  return n;
}
```

## Declarations and Scoping

### Scoping

_Scope_ refers to the part of a program where a variable is visible or available.

For variables defined outside of any function or block, the scope is the whole program‚Äîyou can refer to such bindings wherever you want.
These are called _global_.

But variables created for function parameters or declared inside a function can be referenced only in that function, so they are known as _local_ variables.
This provides some isolation between functions‚Äîeach function call acts in its own little world (its local environment) and can often be understood without knowing a lot about what‚Äôs going on in the global environment.

### `let`, `const`, and `var`

In JavaScript we have three words to declare variables: `let`, `const`, and `var`.

In the pre-ES6 days (before 2015), `var` was the only way to declare variables in JS.
The scope of a variable declared with `var` is its _current execution context_, which is either the enclosing function or, for variables declared outside any function, global.
This means variables defined with `var` are **not** block scoped.

```js
if (true) {
  var x = 5;
}
console.log(x);
// ‚Üí 5
```

This brings us to a classic problem

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}
```

What do you think this will output?
How can we fix it to output "correctly"?

To solve this odd behavior ES6 introduced two new ways to declare variables: `let` and `const`.
Variables declared with `let` and `const` are scoped to the block that they are declared in. If you create one of those inside of a loop, the code before and after the loop cannot ‚Äúsee‚Äù it.

```js
if (true) {
  let y = 5;
}
console.log(y); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: y is not defined
```

### Immutability (sort of)

The difference between `let` and `const` is that a variable declared with `let` (and `var`) can be reassigned whereas a `const` cannot (hence the term **const**ant).

```js
let myLetStr = "First it's this";
myLetStr = "Now it's this"; // ‚úÖ

const myConstStr = "Hello";
myConstStr = "Goodbye"; // ‚ùå TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

Note that variables defined with `const` are not technically immutable.
We can actually mutate the data as long as we don't reassign the variable.

```js
const dogs = ["golden retriever", "dalmatian"];
dogs.push("chihuahua"); // ‚úÖ
dogs = ["husky"]; // ‚ùå TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

We should prefer to use `const` wherever possible in order to reduce confusion with reassignment.
If our program ever tries to reassign something unexpectedly, we will get an error.

### Hoisting

<!-- TODO: shorten -->

_Hoisting_ can be thought of as automatically bringing variable declarations to the top of their respective blocks so that variables can be used before they are declared.

The actual definition is a bit more complex:

> Conceptually, for example, a strict definition of hoisting suggests that variable and function declarations are physically moved to the top of your code, but this is not in fact what happens. Instead, the variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase, but stay exactly where you typed them in your code.
>
> ‚Äî [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)

Only `var` and `function` declarations are hoisted.
One of the advantages of this is that it allows you to use a function before you declare it in your code.

```js
catName("Chloe"); // ‚úÖ

function catName(name) {
  console.log("My cat's name is " + name);
}
```

We can also do this with `var` declarations:

```js
myCat = "Chloe";
console.log(myCat); // ‚úÖ
var myCat;
```

For all intents and purposes the interpreter sees

```js
var myCat;
myCat = "Chloe";
console.log(myCat); // ‚úÖ
```

Notice that I still had to define (assign) the variable before using it.
_Declarations_ will be hoisted, _definitions_ will not.

Accessing an undeclared `var` variable will yield `undefined`.

```js
console.log(myCat); // ‚úÖ but will print "undefined"
var myCat;
```

üôÑ You're probably starting to notice how confusing this all is.

Personally, I am fine with hoisted function declarations.
It allows us to write functional code without having to worry about order.
We can organize our code in a way that makes sense for us.

However, I think it is a bit wack that variables can be used before they are declared.
This is one of the reasons `let` and `const` were added to the spec in ES6.

Notice:

```js
myCat = "Chloe"; // ‚ùå ReferenceError: myCat is not defined
console.log(myCat);
let myCat;
```

This code errors on the first line with `ReferenceError: myCat is not defined`.
I think this is much more expected behavior.
We get an actual error when a variable is accessed in an unexpected location.

An error, rather than silently evaluating to `undefined`, is much more helpful for debugging.

These are a few of the reasons JavaScript developers should prefer `let`/`const` over `var`.

## Types

<!-- TODO: Scott -->

I sorted these into types that I use frequently. I figured it be useful to study things that might appear more often.

### Object

Javascript has an `Object` type that wraps all things during execution. This will be discussed further in the OOP section

### Primitives

#### String

Strings are used all the time and frequently throughout programming. Any type of word, message, love letter, etc. consists of a string.

A string is really just a collection of characters. In most programming languages, including JavaScript, strings are highly similar to arrays.

Strings can be more than just normal language characters. You can use most Unicode characters and inline string operations with a `\` (backslash) followed by the correct code

```js
// Using the "new line" escaped character
console.log("Something\nFun");
// ‚ûù Something
// ‚ûù Fun
```

Common String operations are:

- Checking the length of a string
- Accessing a character in the string
- Comparing strings

Overloaded string operator:

- `+`: Concatenates two strings into one. Usually the plus sign is an addition operator, but in strings it is the "combining" operator.

```js
const str = "My friends";

console.log(str.length);
// ‚ûù 10 (includes whitespace)

const firstCharacter = str[0];
console.log(firstCharacter);
// ‚ûù M

const str2 = "My friends";
console.log(str == str2);
// ‚ûù true

const str3 = str + str2;
console.log(str3);
// ‚ûù My Friends My Friends
```

There is a ton of operations on strings. Please refer to the [MDN - Strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) section of the docs to learn more.

#### Boolean

These types are your standard true and false values. JavaScript has `true` and `false` keywords. However, JavaScript also uses _truthy_ and _falsy_ values, as well, to cover all of the other types during execution. _Truthy_ and _Falsy_ will be covered later in the **Program Structure** section.

If you want to convert an object to be exactly `true` or `false`, you can use the `!!` (double bang) operator.

```js
const bool = true;
let pet = new Animal();
console.log(bool == !!pet);
// ‚ûù true
```

#### Number

Numbers are your bread and butter to anything math related. Counting in loops, adding two numbers, finding the volume of a cube? The Number type can solve all of that because it covers integers and floating-point values.

In JavaScript, there is no distinction between:

- int
- short
- long
- float
- double
- etc.

Numbers are 64-bit values. Most of the bits are used to maintain the value of the number itself. However, some bits go into maintaining the sign and/or decimal placement in the number (you won't get 64 bits worth of value storage). Since floating-point rules apply, be careful of high-precision results; you could lose precision.

##### Infinity

In order to deal with numbers that overflow normal limits of storage, Special `Number` type key words:

- `Infinity`: behaves an acts like infinity
- `-Infinity`: negative of `Infinity`

```js
// ============== Infinity ===================
console.log(Infinity); // ‚ûù Infinity
console.log(Infinity + 1); // ‚ûù Infinity
console.log(Math.pow(10, 1000)); // ‚ûù Infinity
console.log(Math.log(0)); // ‚ûù -Infinity
console.log(1 / Infinity); // ‚ûù 0
```

##### NaN

`NaN`: Represents "Not a Number". Returned when Math functions fail

> NaN compares unequal (via ==, !=, ===, and !==) to any other value -- including to another NaN value. Use Number.isNaN() or isNaN() to most clearly determine whether a value is NaN. Or perform a self-comparison: NaN, and only NaN, will compare unequal to itself.
>
> -- MDN

```js
// =============== NaN =======================
NaN === NaN; // ‚ûù false
Number.NaN === NaN; // ‚ûù false
isNaN(NaN); // ‚ûù true
isNaN(Number.NaN); // ‚ûù true

function valueIsNaN(num) {
  return num !== num;
}
valueIsNaN(1); // ‚ûù false
valueIsNaN(NaN); // ‚ûù true
valueIsNaN(Number.NaN); // ‚ûù true
```

##### Math

Math Details:

- Order of operations (PEMDAS) still applies
- All operations on numbers result in floating-point arithmetic.
  - `/`: Standard division does not truncate decimal values; it maintains floating point precision.
  - `%`: Modulus operator still takes the remainder.

#### undefined

> A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned
>
> -- MDN

#### null

> The intentional absence of any value.
>
> -- MDN

`null` is case-sensitive:

- `null` does not equal `Null` or `NULL`, etc.

#### Symbol (New)

> Definition: A symbol is a primitive which cannot be recreated.
>
> -- MDN

Symbols are primarily used for Object keys to ensure that each key is unique.

#### BigInt (New)

> Definition: a built-in object that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 2^53
>
> -- MDN

Worried about overflowing a Number primitive?? Worry no more!

BigInt values can give you as much space as you want / need by dynamically allocating memory space for those massive numbers.

## Program Structure

### Control Flow

#### If/else

Standard logic conditional to control program flow.

```js
if() {
  // do something
} else if() {
  // do something based on the 'conditon'
} ... {

} else {

}

```

#### Switch

A clean way of doing if / else chains.

The below example accepts a Number as input, and can match that number to a specific "case" in the switch statement.

Once the case is matched, you execute the code until the break.

- If no `break` exists, then the code will "fall through" to the next `case`.
- If no `case` is matched, you execute the `default` code.
- If no `default` case exists, then the code will just bypass all logic in the `switch` like normal `if` execution.

```js
switch (numOfStudents) {
  case 1:
    // do something;
    break;
  case 2:
  case 3:
    // do something;
    break;
  default:
  // do some default behavior.
}
```

You can accept any value that can be equated in the parameter of the switch statement. For example:

```js
switch (fruitType) {
  case "Oranges":
    console.log("Oranges are $0.59 a pound.");
    break;
  case "Apples":
    console.log("Apples are $0.32 a pound.");
    break;
  case "Bananas":
    console.log("Bananas are $0.48 a pound.");
    break;
  case "Cherries":
    console.log("Cherries are $3.00 a pound.");
    break;
  case "Mangoes":
    console.log("Mangoes are $0.56 a pound.");
    break;
  case "Papayas":
    console.log("Mangoes and papayas are $2.79 a pound.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Sorry, we are out of " + fruitType + ".");
}
```

#### Falsy

> A falsy value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context. JavaScript uses Type Conversion to coerce any value to a Boolean in contexts that require it, such as conditionals and loops.

Essentially, JavaScript will attempt to resolve the value of anything that is not `false` to be _falsy_ in order to continue with operation.

Example falsy values:

```js
if (false)
if (null)
if (undefined)
if (0)
if (0n)
if (NaN)
if ('')
if ("")
if (``)
if (document.all)
```

If the first object of a logical "And" operator `&&` in the expression is _falsy_, then that object will be returned.

```js
let pet = false && "dog";
// ‚ûù false
```

If the first object of a logical "Or" operator `||` in the expression is _falsy_, then the second object will be returned.

```js
let pet = false || "dog";
// ‚ûù dog
```

#### Truthy

> In JavaScript, a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy (i.e., except for false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN).

Truthy values are essentially the opposite to _falsy_ values. Each of these values will result in a `true` during runtime.

Example truthy values:

```js
if (true)
if ({})
if ([])
if (42)
if ("0")
if ("false")
if (new Date())
if (-42)
if (12n)
if (3.14)
if (-3.14)
if (Infinity)
if (-Infinity)
```

## Functions

There are a few ways to create functions in JavaScript.

### Function Expression

```js
// or you can use let or var
const power = function(num, exp) {
  return num ** exp;
};
```

```js
function power(num, exp) {
  return num ** exp;
}
```

In JavaScript, functions are _first-class citizens_.
This means a function can be treated like any variable:
you can use it in arbitrary expressions, not just call it.
It is possible to store a function value in a new variable, pass it as an argument to a function, and so on.
Similarly, a variable that holds a function is still just a regular variable and can, if not constant, be assigned a new value, like so:

```js
let launchMissiles = function() {
  missileSystem.launch("now");
};

if (safeMode) {
  launchMissiles = function() {
    /* do nothing */
  };
}
```

Notice how I can refer to the function without parenthesis in order to use it just like a variable.
Referencing a function name with parenthesis will execute that function and return its evaluated result.

Referencing a function name _without_ parenthesis allows us to use the function like any other variable.
We can even pass it into other functions like so

```js
function wrapper(callback) {
  callback(); // Execute the function passed in
}

function celebrate() {
  console.log("üéâ");
}

wrapper(celebrate);
// ‚Üí üéâ
```

I can also pass an anonymous function in as my callback:

```js
function wrapper(callback) {
  callback(); // Execute the function passed in
}

wrapper(function() {
  console.log(`Woooo!`);
});
// ‚Üí Woooo!
```

This seems silly now, but this will be very useful when we talk more about callbacks‚Äîa very important part of JS.

### Optional arguments

The following code is allowed and executes without any problem:

```js
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
console.log(square(4, true, "random string"));
// ‚Üí 16
```

We defined `square` with only one parameter, yet when we call it with three the language doesn‚Äôt complain. It ignores the extra arguments and computes the square of the first one.

JavaScript is extremely lax about the number of arguments you pass to a function. If you pass too many, the extra ones are ignored. If you pass too few, the missing parameters get assigned the value `undefined`.

The downside of this is that it is possible‚Äîlikely, even‚Äîthat you‚Äôll accidentally pass the wrong number of arguments to functions. And no one will tell you about it.

The upside is that this behavior can be used to allow a function to be called with different numbers of arguments. For example, this minus function tries to imitate the `-` operator by acting on either one or two arguments:

```js
function minus(a, b) {
  if (b === undefined) return -a;
  else return a - b;
}

console.log(minus(10));
// ‚Üí -10
console.log(minus(10, 5));
// ‚Üí 5
```

### Default arguments

Functions can have default arguments for parameters.
If no value is passed for that parameter, the default will be used instead of `undefined`.

To specify a default argument add a `=` after a function parameter followed by the default value.

For example, this version of `power` makes its second argument optional.
If you don‚Äôt provide it or pass the value `undefined`, it will default to `2`, and the function will behave like `square`.

```js
function power(base, exponent = 2) {
  return base ** exponent;
}

console.log(power(4));
// ‚Üí 16
console.log(power(2, 6));
// ‚Üí 64
```

### `arguments` keyword and rest parameters

Functions expose a number of useful objects by default.
These are basically objects that every function (with the exception of _arrow functions_) automatically creates at runtime.

One of these useful objects is `arguments`

> `arguments` is an `Array`-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.
>
> ‚Äî [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)

This is essentially another way to access function arguments.
It is especially useful if you have a function that can accept any number of arguments.

For example:

```js
function showMyFriends() {
  if (arguments.length > 0) {
    console.log(`I have so many friends!`);
    console.log(`My best friend is ${arguments[0]}`); // access like any array
  } else {
    console.log(`I have no friends üòû`);
  }
}

showMyFriends("Kevin", "Miles");
// ‚Üí I have so many friends!
// ‚Üí My best friend is Kevin
```

This is pretty nifty! But since we're modern developers who use modern JavaScript, we should prefer ES6's fancy new _rest parameters_.

The rest parameter syntax accomplishes the same thing as the `arguments` array, but it achieves it in a much more readable and reliant way.
This syntax allows us to represent an indefinite amount of arguments as a single parameter.

A function's last parameter can be prefixed with `...` which will cause all remaining supplied arguments to be placed within a standard JavaScript `Array`. Only the last parameter can be a rest parameter.

```js
function showMeAndMyFriends(me, ...friends) {
  console.log(`Hi, my name is ${me}`);
  if (friends.length > 0) {
    console.log(`I have so many friends!`);
    console.log(`My best friend is ${friends[0]}`); // access like any array
  } else {
    console.log(`I have no friends üòû`);
  }
}

showMeAndMyFriends("Andrew", "Kevin", "Miles");
// ‚Üí I have so many friends!
// ‚Üí My best friend is Kevin
```

As the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters#Difference_between_rest_parameters_and_the_arguments_object) highlight, there are three main differences between rest parameters and the `arguments` object:

- rest parameters are only the arguments that haven't been given a separate name (i.e. formally defined in the function expression), while the `arguments` object contains all arguments passed to the function. **This improves code clarity and reduces boilerplate code**.
- the `arguments` object is not a real array, while rest parameters are `Array` instances, meaning methods like `sort`, `map`, `forEach` or `pop` can be applied on it directly.
- the `arguments` object has additional functionality specific to itself (like the `callee` property).

There are still reasons to use the `arguments` object (as the last point mentions), but these are advanced features that you probably won't ever need. Stick to rest parameters as often as you can.

### `this` keyword

Another important binding is `this`.
It refers to the the object which is _currently executing the function_.

If the function is a method of an object, `this` will refer to that object.

```js
const dog = {
  name: "Spots",
  whoAmI() {
    console.log(this);
  }
};

dog.whoAmI();
// ‚Üí { name: 'Spots', whoAmI: [Function: whoAmI] }
```

If the function is a plain ol' function, `this` will either refer to the `window` object (in the browser) or the `global` object (in Node).

```js
function whereAmI() {
  console.log(this);
}

whereAmI();
// ‚Üí Object [global]
```

**Woah, hold up. `window` object? `global` object?**
These are basically the highest level objects that store/call global variables and functions.
Think of it as the object that contains all the data about the environment.
This is where functions that are always available live (such as `setTimeout`).

In the browser, this is an object called `window` which represents the current web page.
Since Node processes don't have a window or page, they call their global object, well, `global`.

You can read more about the `window` object on the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window), and you can read more about the `global` object on the [Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global).

### Arrow functions

ES6 introduced a new notation for functions called _arrow functions_.

```js
const power = (num, exp) => {
  return num ** exp;
};
```

We put the argument parameters between parenthesis follow by the arrow (`=>`).
These functions are called in the exact same way as normal functions.

```js
power(2, 3);
```

Arrow functions are treated pretty much just like regular functions.
They were primarily introduced as syntactical sugar to make code less verbose.
We will most often see the arrow syntax used for anonymous callback functions, which we will discuss in a minute.

There are a few syntactical improvements you can make to arrow functions if you want to trim down code.

1. If there is only one argument, you can omit the parenthesis

```js
const square = num => {
  return num * num;
};
```

2. If the function body is only one line, you can omit the curly braces. Whatever is evaluated on that one line is also what will be returned from the function.

```js
const square = num => num * num;
```

When an arrow function has no parameters at all, its parameter list is just an empty set of parentheses.

```js
const horn = () => {
  console.log(`Toot`);
};
```

Arrow functions have a few key differences from classic functions. Most importantly, arrow functions do not create their own bindings to the `this` or `arguments` keywords.

The fact that we don't have access to `arguments` is no problem because we have our handy _rest parameters_ (just be sure to wrap it in parenthesis):

```js
const concatenate = (...words) => words.join(``);
console.log(concatenate(`race`, `car`));
```

On the other hand, the absence of a bound `this` in arrow functions solves some pre-ES6 problems.

Paraphrasing from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#No_separate_this):
until arrow functions, every new function defined its own this value based on how the function was called.
This proved to be less than ideal with an object-oriented style of programming.

For example, take this `person` object that ages every second.

```js
const person = {
  age: 0,
  growUp() {
    setInterval(function() {
      console.log(`I am ${this.age} years old`);
      this.age++;
    }, 1000);
  }
};

person.growUp();
// ‚Üí I am undefined years old
// ‚Üí I am NaN years old
```

wtf? What's happening here?

Let's take a look at what `this` is in our `setInterval`:

```js
const person = {
  age: 0,
  growUp() {
    setInterval(function() {
      console.log(this);
      // console.log(`I am ${this.age} years old`);
      // this.age++;
    }, 1000);
  }
};

person.growUp();
// ‚Üí Timeout
```

Looks like `this` refers to the `Timeout` object, which is the class Node uses to process certain time-based functions (you can read more [here](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#timers_class_timeout)).

See the problem with `this` binding in functions?
We expect `this` to refer to the actual object we are in, but once we have a callback things get dicey.
`person` is _not_ actually the object executing the callback function, so `this` does not refer to it.

In the pre-2015 era, there were a few messy ways to deal with this.
[Binding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) was probably the most popular approach, and might see some of this still around in the React community.
However, all of that is completely unnecessary now that we have _arrow functions_.

Arrow functions do not have their own `this`.
When you refer to `this` inside of an arrow function, the _enclosing lexical scope_ is used.
That fancy lingo essentially means go one pair of brackets out and see what `this` refers to there.
Usually it will be the object you want.

So, we can solve our age problem with arrow functions:

```js
const person = {
  age: 0,
  growUp() {
    setInterval(() => {
      console.log(`I am ${this.age} years old`);
      this.age++;
    }, 1000);
  }
};

person.growUp();
// ‚Üí I am 0 years old
// ‚Üí I am 1 years old
// etc
```

### Callbacks and higher-order functions

In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Functions that do this are called _higher-order functions_. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a _callback_ function.

These are used often in asynchronous programming as well as a number of array functions.

For example, `setTimeout` is an asynchronous higher-order function that accepts a callback

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Heyyyyy");
}, 1000);
// ‚Üí Heyyyyy (after 1 second)
```

Callbacks are used in the browser as well.
That is how we handle events.
We will see a lot of this with React.

### Closures

Closures are a functional solution to object-oriented problems.
Let's look at a use case to understand.

Suppose you want to use a variable for counting something, and you want this counter to be available to all functions.

You could use a global variable along with a function for incrementing the counter:

```js
// Initiate counter
let counter = 0;

// Function to increment counter
function add() {
  counter += 1;
}

add();
add();
add();

console.log(counter);
// ‚Üí 3
```

There is a problem with the solution above: Any code on the page can change the counter without calling `add`.

The counter should be local to the `add` function. In OO terms, this would be _encapsulation_ or _private_ data.

A naive solution:

```js
function add() {
  let counter = 0;
  counter += 1;
  return counter;
}

add();
add();
console.log(add());
// ‚Üí 1
```

Obviously this won't work because `counter` is redefined every time we run `add`.
We need a way to define `counter` once _and_ have a publicly available function that can access our private `counter`.

We need to take advantage of the _lexical environment_:

```js
function makeCounter() {
  // define counter (only scoped to this environment)
  let counter = 0;
  // notice I return an actual function
  return () => {
    counter += 1;
    return counter;
  };
}

const add = makeCounter();

add();
add();
console.log(add());
// ‚Üí 3
```

Lexical environment simply refers to the scope of where variables are written.
Remember, this is how JavaScript determines which variables can "see" one another.

In our above example, `counter` shares a lexical environment with the anonymous function we return from `makeCounter` (which we eventually call `add`).
This allows `add` to access and modify `counter` without the variable leaking into the global scope.

**One other interesting example:**
Closures are also great for function factories

```js
function makeAdder(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}

const add5 = makeAdder(5);
const add10 = makeAdder(10);

console.log(add5(2)); // ‚Üí 7
console.log(add10(2)); // ‚Üí 12
```

Closures are one of the most confusing concepts in JavaScript.
Don't worry if you don't perfectly get it yet.
Just make sure you understand that

- closures allow for private data encapsulation
- closures can be used as function factories

If you would like to learn more about closures, check out [MDN's extensive documentation on the subject](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).

## [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

> Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them.
>
> -- MDN

Let us try to break this apart little by little.

"A list-like structure" is something that can hold values together and "whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations" means that we can navigate, access, and change elements in this list with built in methods.

So we can make, access, modify, and navigate collections of things like so:

```js
const coll = []; // Empty array construction
const coll2 = ["zero", "one", "two"]; // Initialize an array with values

console.log(coll2); // ‚ûù ['zero', 'one', 'two']
console.log(coll2[0]); // ‚ûù 'zero'
console.log(coll2.length); // ‚ûù 3
```

[Additional array related functionality](https://github.com/talent-path-la/javascript-review/blob/master/arrays.js)

"Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed." This is a huge feature / pain depending on how you look at it. JS basically takes away the insurance of two separate things when using raw arrays:

1. You don't know if sequential array elements will be next to each other in memory at any given time.
2. Each of those elements in an array can be of any type.

```js
const mixedBag = ["hello", 3, `friends`, true, new Friend()];
// This type of array is allowed in JS
```

"Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them."

**NOTE**: Arrays can grow and shrink to any size determined by the number of elements you have within. So, be careful of how much you put into an array. A _sparce_ (non-dense) array does not care how many zero values it places between elements; it will take up as much space as you let it.

## OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

### Why do we care?

JavaScript is full of objects. In fact, you could go so far to say that _EVERYTHING_ in JavaScript is an object.

> If people feel skeptical, tell them to wait for the prototype chain part...

We want to be able to make something that has data and manipulate that data in an organized, scalable, extensible way.

### Basics: Objects

#### Anatomy of an Object

- **Property:** any key / value pair where:
  - Key: must be a string or [Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)
  - Value: anything

#### Execution

There are a few ways to make raw objects.

```js
const obj1 = {}; // object literal
const obj2 = Object.create();

//----------Functions-----------------

function MyObject() {
  return {};
}
obj3 = MyObject();

function MyConstructor(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
obj4 = new MyConstructor("bob");
```

Teaching Instructions:

- Start attaching things to the object and showing how JavaScript is a dynamic language.
- Show that variables and functions being values in a property.

### Basics: Prototypes

How do we know what an object should do? How are we supposed to interact with these various things that are floating around our program?

Traditionally,

When you make a string:

```js
const str = "hello";
```

Teaching instructions:

- Dive into the object
- Take a look at the \_proto\_ chain of each of these things and explain that everything has attached functionality, because everything is an object.
- Add a method to the prototype chain and make multiple objects from it.

That string variable `str` gets converted into the JavaScript equivalent of the `String` class. Each of those strings have available methods (modifiers of class data) to use.

![String methods](console-string-methods.png)

And this is what it looks like when you investigate the String \_proto\_ that is attached to every String object.

![String prototype](console-string-prototype.png)

Standard function expressions are used to make objects because they have a prototype attached to them. However, arrow functions are not useful as constructors. Arrow functions do not bind to its own `this` variable and therefore make terrible constructors.

### New-ish: ES6 Classes

A stylistic wrapper to make OOP easier to use is `class` syntax. A class is a template that can be used to construct objects. If you are more familiar with C-based languages, this will feel right at home.

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const dog = new Pet("Max");
```

We are not just limited to data as well; we can supply methods to manipulate said data.

```js
class Pet {
  static isDog(animal) {
    return Object.getPrototypeOf(animal).constructor.name === this.name;
  }

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  doTrick(trick) {
    console.log(`I can ${trick}. Watch this!`);
  }
}
```

Methods can be added to classes:

- `doTrick(trick)` is a method specific to the object instance. In other words, it is used to manipulate data that could be changed among objects of the same class.
- `isDog(animal)` is a static method. Static methods are like prototypes where they can be shared among objects and their effects are the same.

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  doTrick(trick) {
    console.log(`I can ${trick}. Watch this!`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }

  sit() {
    console.log(`I am sitting`);
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog("Mike");
myDog.doTrick("jump");

// Output: I can jump. Watch this!
```

Inheritance can also be used with the `extends` key word. Classes the inherit must use the `super` keyword to pass data to the parent's constructor to initialize data.

### Theory of OOP

Four pillars of OOP:

![Four pillars of OOP](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*137Rnofd7QBjXu9zUd6MXQ.png)

<!--
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
-->

#### Abstraction

In computers we never make the things we represent; we make abstractions of those concepts. OOP can represent real-life objects like animals, cars, people. However, it can also represent a process or idea. Not everything needs to be real, but objects can create structure for it, nonetheless.

**How would we abstract a card?**

#### Encapsulation

Do you want data to be relevant to the object? Do you want methods to manipulate that data?

Encapsulation gives you a space that is separated from the outside environment (in loose terms).

**A Deck contains Cards**

#### Inheritance

I have something that is strongly related to another thing. Maybe they have some sort of relationship or share data / functionality

Inheritance allows you to build relationships between objects so that you do not have to rewrite code in those objects.

Ex: Everything in JS is an object. The `String` class **inherits** from the `Object` class to get some basic methods.

**WARNING** Inheritance can be dangerous if too vertical relationships are made. Changes in the base class ripple down through all child classes.

#### Polymorphism

More advanced, can be covered later.

## Asynchronous Programming

We have covered earlier that JavaScript is a "single-threaded" language, which means that it only can run on process at a time. So, how do we get asynchronous code on a sequential execution.

The event loop is how JavaScript can run any asynchronous code.

This response from Stack Overflow ties the concepts well together: [Does async programming mean multi-threading?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8963209/does-async-programming-mean-multi-threading)

> In an asynchronous environment, a single process thread runs all the time, but it may, for event-driven reasons (and that is the key), switch from one function to another. When an event happens, and when the currently running process hits a point at which it must wait for another event, the javascript core then scans its list of events and delivers the next one, in a (formally) indeterminate (but probably deterministic) order, to the event manager.

JavaScript just looks like it is doing a ton of different things at once, but it is just switching quickly between tasks at idle moments in order to maximize usage of the processor.

### Callbacks

> A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

```js
function greeting(name) {
  alert("Hello " + name);
}

// Synchronous callback
function processUserInput(callback) {
  var name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);
```

### Promises

> The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

![Promise Flow](https://process.filestackapi.com/cache=expiry:max/resize=width:1050/50VOVysgSY6RX2wEN6hL)

[Promise Cheat Sheet](https://devhints.io/promise)

Example Asynchronous Promise: Use the Fetch API

```js
/*
Requests information from a source by 
creating a Promise and waiting for said 
resource to respond with an event.
*/
fetch("http://example.com/movies.json")
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json(); // Chains to the next .then()
  })
  .then(function(myJson) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(myJson));
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

### Async/Await

> The async function declaration defines an asynchronous function, which returns an AsyncFunction object. An asynchronous function is a function which operates asynchronously via the event loop, using an implicit Promise to return its result. But the syntax and structure of your code using async functions is much more like using standard synchronous functions.

`async / await` is just a wrapper around the `Promise` type. Instead of having to write _chained_ functions, one after another. You can use `async / await` to make your code look more synchronous.

`async / await` is not meant to replace `Promise` type interactions. It is a nice tool to involve synchronous code and improve readability in a given context.

```js
// Comparison between both with a weird example

// ============ Promise =================
function jump() {
  getEnergyToJump().then(energy => {
    execute(energy);
  });
}

// ============ Async / Await ===========
async function jump() {
  // An async function call that is necessary in order to finish current execution.
  const energy = await getEnergyToJump();
  execute(energy);
}
```

## Error Handling

### Try / Catch

When you have a block of code that could be prone to errors / bugs, you might want to wrap it in a `try {}` block. However, every `try` block should have a proceeding `catch() {}` block along with it

```js
const getUserData = database => {
  try {
    const data = database.find("user");
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
};
```

If the code within the `try` block fails:

- It immediately generates an `Error` object that breaks the normal programming flow.
- This object will travel up the call stack until something resolves the error or the program crashes.

The first thing that could resolve the error is the `Catch` block. In the code snippet above, `err` is the `Error` object that was generated when `database.find('user')` failed. All we do with the error is resolve it by logging it to the console. Since I don't know what to do with the error right now, logging it is the best I can do.

### Throw

Continuing our example from above, a better solution to handling an error we don't know what to do with is to `throw` the error.

```js
const getUserData = database => {
  try {
    const data = database.find("user");
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    throw err; // DEV: Now I added a throw expression.
  }
};
```

Now, my error handling allows whatever called `getUserData()` to deal with the error and logs the issue where it happened (better for debugging).

**Just be careful!** If you never resolve the problem and continue to throw the error, your program will crash.

### Finally (New)

Continuing our example from above... If I had something that **MUST** be done after my `try` and `catch` blocks, it can be done in a `finally` block.

```js
const getUserData = database => {
  try {
    const data = database.find("user");
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    throw err;
  } finally {
    console.log("Database operations: Finished"); // DEV: log when done.
  }
};
```

Now, in my `finally` block, I log when this function completes **NO MATTER WHAT**.

If the `try` block is:

- Successful: `try -> finally`
- Unsuccessful: `try -> catch -> finally`

**Just be careful!** If you have code that fails in the finally, there is no `catch` block to save you.
