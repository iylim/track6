# Making a learning platform

Julie Needs:

- A detailed project plan to give to the board for project approval.

## Problem Overview

This is a scaling issue of getting people on board. The hope for the future is that Talent Path can have a more formalized, systematic process to find and hire great talent.

The current hiring **pipeline** is done with:

- referrals
- job postings
- university partnerships
- direct hire (lots of work, but effective)
- website
- applications
