- website
- applications

## Problem (Our Understanding)

Talent Path is anticipating an increase in demand from employers around America. Employers are looking to hire qualified talent in bulk. However, Talent Path does not have a recruiting pipeline that can scale with the company. Another challenge that Talent Path faces is that people come into Talent Path with different levels of expertise. The sourcing and acquiring of new talent at such a scale is challenging with the current way of recruiting, which involves a highly manual screening process that can be automated with the correct tool(s).

## Our Solution

The solution is to create a web-based learning tool that qualifies and builds a recruitment pipeline and database for potential candidates. Our plan is to develop and deploy a free learning/training experience to automate the technical assessment and qualifying of the recruitment process.

The online platform will be accesible for any potential Talent Path candidates giving a new way of identifying, qualifying, and hiring talent. This will not only drive efficiency, but also save costs in the hiring process.

Users will be able to complete a list of educational modules that provides fundamental industry information and tests their readiness as potential hires. The promise of possible employment at the end of a "path" provides value over a generalized, online learning platform.
