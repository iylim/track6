# Making a learning platform

Overview:

I want an elaborate project pitch.  
Get in the timeline to the board and have a solid project plan.  
This is a scaling issue of getting people on board.

- referrals

- direct hire (lots of work, but effective)
- website
- applications

Users:

Core Value:

- We don't want to make people go into debt after paying money for expensive programs like:
  - college
  - boot camps
- The promise of Talent Path that you will be an employee
- Training that can give you the skills to become better in a relevant technology-related occupation

Values:

- Give people the opportunity to catch up to the level of standards that Talent Path has.
