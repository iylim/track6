# Week 1: Welcome

## Tuesday

### Discord

[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is text/voice chat, kind of like Slack or Skype.
This is how we will handle day-to-day communications.

1. Join our server with this [link](https://discord.gg/wHVRTFQ).
2. Post a greeting in `general-chat`
3. Drop your contact info in `contact-info`
4. Give me a music suggestion in `music-suggestions`

Once you get in, you will notice that there are a bunch of channels, including:

- `general-chat`: most chatting goes here
- `coding-questions`: any questions you have for any kind of code (even things outside of class) can be asked here
- `class-notes`: anytime I want to link certain repos for exercises or notes I will put them here
- `general-resources`: collection of nice resources for things we are learning. You can go back through this channel and see a bunch of things that people from the old cohort found
- `cool-stuff`: kind of like general resources, but more for interesting stuff (both code and non-code) people find
- `extracurricular-hangouts`: if we're planning any events outside of work, it'll usually happen here

Your cohort also has its own chat in `trainee-chat` if you ever want to discuss things with just Track 6 folks.

### Tech Overview

#### What have we used before?

#### What do we want to learn about?

### Machine Setup

For development there are a few tools that you need.
There are many different version of a lot of these tools,
but I recommend that every one downloads the same ones so that we can all be on the same page.
Of course, if you have your own preferences then go ahead and use those (I just might not be able to help as easily if you run into an issue).

Install the following:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): editor
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): source control management
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/): git client

You will also need to make a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you do not have one already.

#### VS Code

This is your code editor, where you will be doing most of your work.
VS Code is an open source editor made by Microsoft

The following extensions are required:

- [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome): lets us run debug sessions in VS Code from Chrome
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): allows us to lint or JavaScript, showing style and syntax errors

The following extensions are some of my favorites (optional):

- [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer): allows matching brackets to be identified with colours
- [DotENV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv): syntax highlighting for `.ENV` files

### The Command Line: Basics

[Basic Command Sheet](https://skillcrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1a-TerminalCommandsCheatsheetMac.pdf)

#### Navigation

- `ls`: (List Segments) Shows all of the contents within your current searching directory.
- `cd <directory>`: (Change Directory) Changes from your current directory to the one provided in the `<directory>` argument.
  - Directories can be relative or absolute.
  - If no directory is provided, then you go back to your default directory.
  - If `..` is provided, then you move up one parent directory

#### File Management

- `pwd`: (Print working directory) Prints the working directory (absolute path) that you are currently in.

#### Process

- `ctrl + c`: Kill current process. If you are running a process that must be stopped for the following reasons:
  - runs indefinitely and must be stopped manually
  - crashes and cannot restart
  - just needs to be murked

#### NPM

- `npm help`: Lots of lovely helpful hints on how to use npm.
- `npm init`: Start an npm module (creates a package.json)
- `npm run <command>`: Executes a script in your package.json `scripts` section where `<command>` is the name of your script

#### VS Code

All `code` related commands are due to VS Code related setup involving installation onto your machine. If you have a windows, you might need to go some extra steps to get this command set up properly.

- `code <directory> / <file>`: Opens VS Code with that folder / file
- `code -r .`: Reloads your current directory's window.

#### Code-along

**First, try this on the command line:**

1. create directory locally
2. create `README.md` file
3. create repo online
4. `git init`
5. `git add .`
6. `git commit -m "init"`
7. `git remote add origin <new-repository>`
8. `git push -u origin master`
9. ðŸ’µðŸ’µðŸ’µ

Wipe the code from drive

**Now let's do it with GitKraken**

1. clone repo via GitKraken (demonstrate how to do this on command line)
2. Make a new branch (or `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
3. Make an edit
4. Add
5. Commit
6. Push
7. Create pull request
8. Merge and close

#### Skills Check Exercise

**Now everyone do it with [student-directory](https://github.com/talent-path-la/student-directory)**

- clone repo
- make your own branch
- Add your own contact info, using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- commit, push, PR, merge
