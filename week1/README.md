# Week 1: Welcome

## Tuesday

### Discord

[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is text/voice chat, kind of like Slack or Skype.
This is how we will handle day-to-day communications.

1. Join our server with this [link](https://discord.gg/wHVRTFQ).
2. Post a greeting in `general-chat`
3. Drop your contact info in `contact-info`
4. Give me a music suggestion in `music-suggestions`

Once you get in, you will notice that there are a bunch of channels, including:

- `general-chat`: most chatting goes here
- `coding-questions`: any questions you have for any kind of code (even things outside of class) can be asked here
- `class-notes`: anytime I want to link certain repos for exercises or notes I will put them here
- `general-resources`: collection of nice resources for things we are learning. You can go back through this channel and see a bunch of things that people from the old cohort found
- `cool-stuff`: kind of like general resources, but more for interesting stuff (both code and non-code) people find
- `extracurricular-hangouts`: if we're planning any events outside of work, it'll usually happen here

Your cohort also has its own chat in `trainee-chat` if you ever want to discuss things with just Track 6 folks.

Wipe the code from drive

**Now let's do it with GitKraken**

2. Make a new branch (or `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
3. Make an edit
4. Add
5. Commit
6. Push
7. Create pull request
