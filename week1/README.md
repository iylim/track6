## Tuesday

### Discord

[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is text/voice chat, kind of like Slack or Skype.
This is how we will handle day-to-day communications.

1. Join our server with this [link](https://discord.gg/wHVRTFQ).
2. Post a greeting in `general-chat`
3. Drop your contact info in `contact-info`
4. Give me a music suggestion in `music-suggestions`

Once you get in, you will notice that there are a bunch of channels, including:

- `general-chat`: most chatting goes here
- `coding-questions`: any questions you have for any kind of code (even things outside of class) can be asked here
- `class-notes`: anytime I want to link certain repos for exercises or notes I will put them here
- `general-resources`: collection of nice resources for things we are learning. You can go back through this channel and see a bunch of things that people from the old cohort found
- `cool-stuff`: kind of like general resources, but more for interesting stuff (both code and non-code) people find
- `extracurricular-hangouts`: if we're planning any events outside of work, it'll usually happen here

Your cohort also has its own chat in `trainee-chat` if you ever want to discuss things with just Track 6 folks.

### Current Events

Read Tania Rascia's [Everything I Know as a Software Developer Without a Degree](https://www.taniarascia.com/everything-i-know-as-a-software-developer-without-a-degree/)

After reading, discuss the following with your neighbors:

- Do you see any similarities between your journey and Tania's?
- She started her journey a couple of years before you all, how do you think the landscape has changed?
- What would you do differently?
- Does this give you any ideas of new things you would like to learn?

### Tooling Setup

Follow the instructions in the [tooling-config](https://github.com/talent-path-la/tooling-config) repo to get all of the goodies you'll need for development.

### The Command Line: Basics

[Basic Command Sheet](https://skillcrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1a-TerminalCommandsCheatsheetMac.pdf)

#### Navigation

- `ls`: (List Segments) Shows all of the contents within your current searching directory.
- `cd <directory>`: (Change Directory) Changes from your current directory to the one provided in the `<directory>` argument.
  - Directories can be relative or absolute.
  - If no directory is provided, then you go back to your default directory.
  - If `..` is provided, then you move up one parent directory

#### File Management

- `pwd`: (Print working directory) Prints the working directory (absolute path) that you are currently in.

#### Process

- `ctrl + c`: Kill current process. If you are running a process that must be stopped for the following reasons:
  - runs indefinitely and must be stopped manually
  - crashes and cannot restart
  - just needs to be murked

#### NPM

- `npm help`: Lots of lovely helpful hints on how to use npm.
- `npm init`: Start an npm module (creates a package.json)
- `npm run <command>`: Executes a script in your package.json `scripts` section where `<command>` is the name of your script

#### VS Code

All `code` related commands are due to VS Code related setup involving installation onto your machine. If you have a windows, you might need to go some extra steps to get this command set up properly.

- `code <directory> / <file>`: Opens VS Code with that folder / file
- `code -r .`: Reloads your current directory's window.

1. create directory locally
2. create `README.md` file
3. create repo online
4. `git init`
5. `git add .`
6. `git commit -m "init"`
7. `git remote add origin <new-repository>`
8. `git push -u origin master`
9. ðŸ’µðŸ’µðŸ’µ

### A Few JavaScript Things

![Node](https://nodejs.org/static/images/logos/nodejs-new-pantone-black.png)

Node is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JS anywhere, including the console. We can execute any program by running 
```sh
node myfile.js
```

Node also allows us to import packages. Packages are just pieces of code that we can include in our program for extra functionality. 
Most packages can be found on the [Node Pacakge Management (npm) registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). 
We also use _npm_ to download packages into our projects.

Before installing packages to a project we must first make a `package.json` file.
This file basically keeps track of all the packages and their versions.
To easily make a `package.json` run:
```sh
npm init -y
```

(The `-y` tells _npm init_ to use the default settings. You can read more about that [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init)).

You should see a new file called `package.json` appear in the root of your project.

Once you have this file you can now install packages.
We install packages by running:
```sh
npm i <package name>
```

(The `i` stands for install. You can also run `npm install`)

We are going to experiment with a package called [`readline-sync`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync), so run
```sh
npm readline-sync
```

Now that we have this package, we can import it into any file, like so:
```js
const readlineSync = require('readline-sync');
```

The `require` function is how we import a _module_ (package) into a file.

Now we can use however we want!
Take a look at the [docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync) for some use cases and example code.

### Hangman

#### Teams

- Cody & CJ
- Andre & Adam
- Dandy, Dean, & Ayana
- Brennan & Roberto

#### Your Task

With your team, code a hangman game that can be run in the console.
This game must
- use the provided word bank to randomly choose a target word
- accept user input one character at a time
  - if the letter is in the target word, reveal the letters and move to the next turn
  - if the letter is not in the target word, the player receives one strike

The game ends if
- the user correctly guesses all of the letters
- the user gets 5 strikes

At the end of the game, exit the program.
**Bonus:** allow the player to choose if they would like to play again, and if so, start over with a new word

You should give the player feedback via the console such as
- displaying the revealed and unrevealed letters of the target string
- whether a letter was correctly or incorrectly guessed
- number of strikes
- win/lose message

#### Allowed Resources

You may use any resources you find on the internet **except** any solutions to this exact problem (obviously). Google, StackOverflow, and the MDN docs are your friends ðŸ‘«

You will most likely need to use the `readline-sync` package we discussed earlier.
